# Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to fix the build and test failures without reverting previous commits.

## Current Status: Stuck

The `npm run preflight` command is failing due to test failures in `packages/core` that were introduced by a recent merge. My previous attempts to fix this were incorrect.

## Goal

To fix all failing tests and ensure the `main` branch is stable and the build passes.

---

## Step 1: Full Preflight Check and Analysis

**Action:** Run the full preflight check to get a clear understanding of all the errors.

1.  Execute `npm run preflight`.
2.  Analyze the output to identify all failing tests and linting errors.

**Verification:** I will have a complete list of all issues preventing the build from succeeding.

**Progress:** Completed.

---

## Step 2: Fix Failing Tests and Linting Errors

**Action:** Address all the issues identified in Step 1.

1.  Fix the failing tests in `packages/core/src/core/nonInteractiveToolExecutor.test.ts`.
2.  Fix the failing test in `packages/cli/src/ui/components/InputPrompt.test.tsx`.
3.  Fix any and all linting errors.

**Verification:** `npm run preflight` completes with zero errors, zero warnings, and all tests passing.

**Progress:** Completed.

---

## Step 3: Full Preflight Verification

**Action:** After fixing the individual test suites, run the entire preflight check to ensure the whole project is stable and there are no other regressions.

1.  Execute `npm run preflight`.

**Verification:** The command must complete with zero errors, zero warnings, and all tests passing.

**Progress:** Completed.

---

## Step 4: Final Commit and Push

**Action:** Once the preflight check passes, commit the verified changes.

1.  Stage all changed files.
2.  Create a clear commit message that describes both the startup prompt fix and the test corrections.
3.  Push the final, working commit to the remote repository.

**Verification:** The `git push` command completes successfully.

**Progress:** Not Started.
