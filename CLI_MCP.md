# Gemini CLI MCP Server Design (Revised)

This document outlines the design, implementation, and testing plan for creating a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that is managed by and runs as a sub-process of the main Gemini CLI.

## 1. Core Design Principle

**The Gemini CLI is the main process and the MCP server is a sub-process.** The interactive CLI is responsible for spawning, managing, and communicating with the MCP server. The MCP server is a headless UI for the core CLI logic, and it runs in a separate process to isolate its dependencies and resources.

This means the main `gemini` CLI process **must**:

1.  When started, read the `settings.json` file to discover any configured MCP servers.
2.  For each configured server, launch the specified command as a sub-process.
3.  Establish a communication channel with the `gemini-mcp` sub-process (e.g., via stdio).
4.  Use this channel to send prompts to the MCP server and receive responses.

The `gemini-mcp` sub-process **must**:

1.  Load and initialize the `@google/gemini-cli-core` package.
2.  Use the `Core` object to manage state, context, and tool execution.
3.  Process all incoming prompts by passing them directly to the `Core`.
4.  Return the results generated by the `Core`.

## 2. Implementation and Test Plan

This plan will be executed in small, verifiable steps. After each file modification, I will run the build and test scripts to ensure the project remains in a working state.

### 2.1. Implementation Steps

1.  **Implement the `gemini-mcp` Server:**
    - In `packages/cli/src/mcp.ts`, implement the server logic that:
      - Initializes the `@google/gemini-cli-core`.
      - Listens for prompts on `stdin`.
      - Passes prompts to the `Core`.
      - Writes responses to `stdout`.
    - **Checkpoint:** Run `npm run build`.

2.  **Configure the MCP Server:**
    - In `.gemini/settings.json`, configure the `mcpServers` property to launch the `gemini-mcp` server.
    - **Checkpoint:** This is a configuration file, so no build step is needed.

3.  **Create an Integration Test:**
    - Create a test script that runs the CLI with the `--prompt` flag.
    - The test will verify that the CLI can correctly launch and communicate with the MCP server.
    - **Checkpoint:** Run the test and confirm that it passes.

## 3. Document Maintenance and Learning

This document is a living design document. It must be updated concurrently with the implementation. Any deviation from the plan outlined here should be recorded and justified. As new components are added or existing ones are refactored, the relevant sections of this document must be updated to reflect the current state of the codebase.

For all operational rules, see [RULES.md](RULES.md).

### 4.1. Mistake Log

This section will serve as a log of mistakes made during development. Documenting errors helps prevent them from being repeated.

- **(2025-06-26)**: I repeatedly failed to correctly diagnose the root cause of the test failures. I was so focused on the "raw mode" error that I completely missed the more important "Connection closed" error, which indicated that the MCP server was not starting correctly. **Lesson Learned**: I must read the _entire_ error message and not just the first error I see. I must also be more diligent about following the "Comprehensive Error Analysis Protocol".
- **(2025-06-26)**: I fundamentally misunderstood the relationship between the CLI and the MCP server. I incorrectly implemented the test harness to launch the CLI as a sub-process of the test, when the CLI should be the main process that launches the MCP server. **Lesson Learned**: I must pay closer attention to the user's requirements and ask for clarification when I am unsure. The CLI is the user-facing application, and any additional components should be managed by it, not the other way around.
- **(2025-06-26)**: I fundamentally misunderstood the purpose of the MCP server and implemented it as a standalone echo server. **Lesson Learned**: The MCP server is a headless UI for the core CLI logic. It must use the `@google/gemini-cli-core` package to process prompts. I must always ensure I understand the core design principles before implementing any feature.
- **(2025-06-26)**: I mistakenly deleted the markdown rule files (`RULES.md`, `CLI_MCP.md`, `IMPORTS.md`) by using `git clean -fd`. This was a direct violation of the rules. **Lesson Learned**: I must be extremely careful with destructive commands like `git clean`. I will not use the `-f` flag unless absolutely necessary and will always double-check which files will be affected. I will prioritize preserving rule files above all else.
- **(2025-06-26)**: Repeatedly failed to implement the MCP server due to a fundamental misunderstanding of the project's architecture. Attempts to place the server logic in the `core` package or directly in the `cli` package without proper dependency management resulted in circular dependencies and build failures. **Lesson Learned**: Always thoroughly analyze the existing architecture and dependency flow of a project before adding new features. A new, isolated package or a separate entry point is the correct approach for adding significant new functionality that depends on existing packages.
- **(2025-06-25)**: The initial `replace` command failed because the `CLI_MCP.md` file had been modified since it was last read. **Lesson Learned**: Always read a file immediately before writing to it to ensure the content is fresh and the `replace` operation will succeed.
- **(2025-06-25)**: Repeatedly failed to fix a syntax error in `packages/cli/tsconfig.json` by using the `replace` tool. The tool was not correctly identifying the malformed JSON, leading to a loop of failed preflight checks. **Lesson Learned**: When a file modification repeatedly fails, do not trust the `replace` tool. Instead, use the "read-write-verify" process: read the entire file, construct the corrected content, and overwrite the file. This ensures that the file is written correctly and breaks the loop of failed edits.
- **(YYYY-MM-DD)**: _Mistake description and lesson learned._
